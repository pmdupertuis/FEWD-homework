		<h3>Profile</h3>
		<p>Members of the rhinoceros family are characterized by their large size (they are some of the largest remaining megafauna, with all of the species able to reach one tonne or more in weight); as well as by an herbivorous diet; a thick protective skin, 1.5–5 cm thick, formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice structure; relatively small brains for mammals this size (400–600 g); and a large horn.</p>

		<h3>Experience</h3>
		<p><strong>Support Engineer</strong>, <em>HubSpot</em> ; Cambridge, Ma — 2013-present</br>
		Set in the London offices of the fictional Reynholm Industries, the show revolves around the three staff members of its IT department: a geeky genius named Maurice Moss (Ayoade), the workshy Roy Trenneman (O'Dowd), and Jen Barber (Parkinson), the department head/Relationship Manager, who knows nothing about IT. The show also focuses on the bosses of Reynholm Industries: Denholm Reynholm (Chris Morris) and his son Douglas (Berry).</p>

		<p><strong>Graphic Designer/ Layout Editor</strong>, <em>Spirited Magazine</em> ; Boston Ma — 2010-present</br>
		 The fictitious video game company GameaVision (a play on companies like Activision and Intellivision) and its eccentric employees, mainly the slacker Dave and his high-strung friend Jerry. The entire series takes place in the Silicon Valley city of Sunnyvale, California during the 1980s. The humor of Code Monkeys relies on crude humor and stoner comedy to convey the numerous references to video games, past and present, but mostly games from the 8-bit era. This also extends to cameos from well known video game developers, who appear in the show pitching their ideas to GameaVision for the games that would later make them famous, usually to be rejected, insulted, and sometimes injured or killed off.</p>


		<p><strong>Mac Genius (Troubleshooting and Repair Technician)</strong>, <em>Apple Inc.</em> ; Boston, Ma — 2009-2013</br>
		Kyle seeks refuge at his father's law office, but the Apple agents kidnap him and taser his father. He is thrown into a cell with a Japanese man and a Caucasian woman who also failed to read the Terms. Meanwhile, Cartman embarrasses his mother, Liane, at Best Buy, exposing his buttocks in front of the customers and loudly accusing her of "fucking" him after she offers to buy him the cheaper Toshiba HandiBook. As a result of his outburst, she declines to buy him anything and takes him home.</p>

		<p><strong>Shift Supervisor/ Barista</strong>, <em>Starbucks Coffee Company</em> ; Boston, Ma — 2004-2009</br>
		In 1948, William Rosenberg and Stephen So opened their first restaurant, Open Kettle, in Quincy, Massachusetts before renaming it Dunkin' Donuts in 1950.[7] The idea for the chain came about after previous experiences Rosenberg had selling food in factories and construction sites, where doughnuts and coffee were the two most popular items.[3] By 1955, Rosenberg started selling the franchise of Dunkin' Donuts to others. In 1959, the company began growing, which led Rosenberg to lobby for Dunkin' Donuts at the International Franchise Association. In 2002, Rosenberg passed away at the age of 86 from bladder cancer in his home in Mashpee, Cape Cod.[</p>

		<p><strong>Concierge</strong>, <em>81 Beacon St. Corp</em> ; Boston, Ma — 2008-2009</br>
		The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre around tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), a comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs) and their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.</p>

		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>A feral child (also, colloquially, wild child) is a human child who has lived isolated from human contact from a very young age, and has no (or little) experience of human care, loving or social behavior, and crucially, of human language. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this child abandonment was due to the parents’ rejection of a child’s severe intellectual or physical impairment. </p>

		<h3>Skills</h3>
		<p>nunchuck skills, bow hunting skills, computer hacking skills... Girls only want boyfriends who have great skills.</p>
